Database
========

CryptPad takes an unusual approach to storing documents on the server. User data is simply stored on the file system rather than a database.

Key points
-----------

* Each CryptPad document has information stored on the server in a location determined by a channel id
* The content of each document is encrypted using the encryption key, so that the server cannot read it
* Clients send the channel id to the server to:
  * get the latest information about a document
  * subscribe to ongoing updates while they are connected
  * modify the contents of the document
* each *channel* is stored within its own file on the server
* each change to the document is encoded on a single line of that file

Understanding document URLs
---------------------------

Everything that a client needs in order to interact with a CryptPad document is stored in its URL.

Let's look at an example:

https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/edit/plpAeHfQ4YO49fczV5erSCgd/

Browsers do not send the information after the ``#`` symbol to the server when loading a page, so it is safe to encode private information there.

The information before ``#`` tells the browser which server to connect to, and what resources to download.

This part of the URL ``https://cryptpad.fr/code/`` tells the server to load the code editor.

The remaining information ``#/2/code/edit/plpAeHfQ4YO49fczV5erSCgd/`` is handled with Javascript by the browser.

There are several pieces of information there, separated by slashes.

.. code-block:: javascript

    URL encoding version: 2
    editor mode: edit
    Encryption seed: plpAeHfQ4YO49fczV5erSCgd

Finding a document
------------------

It is possible to run code provided by the CryptPad server in your browser console. To extract the channel id of a document you have open:

- |file-o| **File** > |info-circle| **Properties** > **Document identifier**
- Alternatively you can run this snippet:

.. code-block:: javascript

    require([
        "/common/common-hash.js"
    ], function (Hash) {
        var url = window.location.href;
        var password = "";
        var parsed = Hash.parsePadUrl(url);
        var secret = Hash.getSecrets(parsed.type, parsed.hash, password);
        console.log(secret.channel);
    });

Either method will give a channel id that looks similar to  ``bb1edc4cb7648605284db30dfcd2eebf``.

The corresponding file would be stored on the server, in your CryptPad instance's directory, at ``cryptpad/datastore/bb/bb1edc4cb7648605284db30dfcd2eebf.ndjson``.

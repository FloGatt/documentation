Poll
====

The Polls application is aimed at the facilitation of decisions in small groups of people who trust each other, for example to decide on a meeting date/time.

It is not suited for polling a large number of people, or for situations where the security of the votes is paramount. To cast a vote, each user must have edit rights to the document. This enables each participant to **modify and/or delete answers from other participants**.

.. warning::
   The Poll application is deprecated as of version 4.7 (16th June 2021). Existing polls can still be opened and edited, but the creation of new polls is discouraged (although still possible via |file-o| **File** > |files-o| **Make a copy**).

   Note that the same functionality is available in the new :ref:`app_form` application, where the edit rights limitations above have been addressed.

   Future development will be focused on the :ref:`app_form` application.

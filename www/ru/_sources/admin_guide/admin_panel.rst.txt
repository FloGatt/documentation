.. _admin_panel:

Administration panel
====================

A number of monitoring and configuration options are available through the admin panel to administer your instance without needing to open config files on the server.

The admin panel is available to administrator users (see :ref:`admin_adminusers`).

- **User Menu** (avatar at the top right) > |gears| **Administration**
- or go to https://your-instance.com/admin/

This page repeats the comments present on the admin panels and adds a few clarifications.

General
-------

Flush HTTP Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Force users to download the latest client-side assets (only if your server is in fresh mode).

This includes some configuration changes distributed via ``/api/config``.

Update user quotas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forcing an update of user storage limits can be done any time, but is only necessary in the event of an error.

.. _admin_close_registration:

Close registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not allow any new users to register.

Enable remote embedding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allow documents and media from this instance to be embedded on other websites. This will add an "Embed" option to the Share menu. For security reasons applications that use OnlyOffice (Sheets, Document, Presentation) cannot be embedded even if this setting is active.

Please note that by enabling this settings, you will need to adapt your Nginx configuration file, adding ``vector:`` to pass :ref:`diagnostic tests <admin_checkup>`.

.. _admin_email:

Admin contact email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This email address is displayed on the instance contact page.

This email may be used by the development team, only if :ref:`admin_consent_contact` is given, to warn of security vulnerabilities or in other cases for example matters affecting public facing instances listed in `the directory <https://cryptpad.org/instances/>`_.

.. _admin_instance_info:

Instance information

.. _admin_telemetry_optout:

Server telemetry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Opt-out** of daily messages sent from the instance to the development team's server.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Opt-in** to have the instance included in the `list of public instances <https://cryptpad.org/instances/>`_ on `the CryptPad project site <https://cryptpad.org>`_ if it is intended for public use. We add public instances to our `uptime monitoring <https://uptime.cryptpad.org/status/public-instances>`_ and encourage administrators to follow updates.

In addition to this setting being enabled, the following criteria are required in order to have an instance listed:

- All :ref:`diagnostic tests <admin_checkup>` must pass
- The version of CryptPad must be up to date within 90 days of `the latest release <https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases>`_
- Instance information must be provided in the :ref:`General tab <admin_instance_info>`

- Commitment to give users at least 6 months of advance warning in case of shutting down

.. note::

   The `list of public instances <https://cryptpad.org/instances/>`_ is considered an extension of the CryptPad community. As such, the development team reserves the right to remove instances from the list if their administrators or the groups they represent are in breach of the `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ or for any other reason at their own discretion.

.. _admin_consent_contact:

Consent to contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Toolbar
-------

|wrench| **Tools**: Show/hide the text editor toolbar.

|picture-o| **Insert**: Add an image to the document. The image can be chosen in the drive or uploaded. :badge_user:`Logged in users`

View settings
-------------

The buttons at the top of the editor control the display of text editor elements.

|list-ul| : Show/hide the document outline.

|comment| : Show/hide the comments (a red icon when closed indicates that there are comments).

|expand| : Use the full width of the window for the text editor.

|compress| : Use reduced width "page mode" for the text editor.

To set defaults for these settings, for example to control which sections are visible when recipients visit a shared link to the document, use the **Document Settings** dialog:

|file-o| **File** > |cog| **Document Settings**.

Editing
-------

Headings
++++++++

In order for headings to appear in the outline, they must be formatted as such. To format a heading, select the text or place the cursor on the heading line, then either:

- Use the formatting menu in the toolbar (displays "normal" by default) to select the desired heading level.

- Use the keyboard shortcut: ``Ctrl`` + ``Alt`` + the number of the desired heading level.

Paragraphs
++++++++++

By default the ``Enter`` key creates a new paragraph, adding a line of spacing with the previous paragraph. To add a line-break without adding a new paragraph, use ``Shift`` + ``Enter``.

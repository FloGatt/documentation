Pull requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development team accepts contributions in the form of "pull requests". All requests are considered but the response time can vary according to the complexity of the changes made and the current workload of the team.

Branches
^^^^^^^^

Contributions can be based on the ``main`` branch which is updated with each release and contains stable code. Experienced contributors can also work on the ``staging`` branch which usually contains code planned for the next release and/or under development. This code may be unstable, so the use of this branch is usually discouraged.

Before contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before sending the "pull request" to GitHub, it is important to:

-  Test the code
-  Ensure compliance with coding rules using the ``npm run lint`` command to list syntax errors and inconsistencies
-  Describe the changes and why they were made in the message

:badge_user:`Logged in users`

The creation screen offers a number of options when new documents are
created.

-  **Owned document**: Create the new document as :ref:`owner <owners>`. If the document is created without an owner this setting cannot be modified.

-  **Expiring document**: Specify an expiry date after which the document will be destroyed. This setting cannot be modified after the document is created.

-  **Add a password**: Secure the sharing of the document with a :ref:`password <passwords>`. This setting can be changed later in the :ref:`access` menu.

-  **Template**: Choose to start from a blank document or use a :ref:`template <templates>` as a starting point.

.. note::
   All templates saved in CryptDrive or in teams that you are part of appear on the creation screen. To save a document as a template:

   - In the open document: |file-o| **File** > |cptools new-template| **Save as template**.

   or

   - In the CryptDrive: Drag the document to the |cptools template| **Templates** folder.

   The history toolbar

The history of documents is saved and can be restored if needed. To view and restore the history of a document:

1. |file-o| **File** > |history| **History**.
2. Use the arrows to navigate:

   - |step-backward| and |step-forward| between each edit.
   - |step-backward| |user| and |user| |step-forward| between each author.
   - |step-backward| |users| and |users| |step-forward| between each editing session (when the same group of authors was connected to the document).

3. Restore the displayed version with |check| **Restore** , or close the history without restoring
   with |times| **Close**.

To save storage space, history can be deleted in the document’s :ref:`properties <document_properties>` :badge_owner:`Document owners`

.. note::
   The history functionality works slightly differently in the :ref:`app_sheets` application, due to the integration of OnlyOffice with CryptPad's encrypted real-time collaboration. Please refer to :ref:`spreadsheet history <sheets_history>` for further details.

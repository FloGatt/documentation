CryptPad instances
==================

CryptPad is free software. It can be installed by whoever wants to provide this service in a personal or professional capacity.

This documentation is written and maintained by the development team at XWiki SAS in Paris, France. This team administers the flagship instance at `cryptpad.fr <https://cryptpad.fr>`__, but there are many others. This documentation applies to all instances unless explicitly mentioned.

Please note that this documentation is kept up to date with the latest version of CryptPad: |release|. It is possible that other instances are using earlier versions. Each instance can also have specific settings such as storage space, disabled applications, or custom colors/styles.

We maintain a `list of public CryptPad instances <https://cryptpad.org/instances>`_.

If you are looking to set up a CryptPad instance please refer to the :ref:`admin_guide`.

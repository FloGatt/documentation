"Open the channel in a text editor. Each line of the file represents a set"

" those messages will no longer be sent to clients. Note that the content "
"of each line contains what seems to be random data: this is because all "
"messages are encrypted by clients before being sent to the server. This "

" a document unrecoverable by other means."
